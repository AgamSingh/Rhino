# Rhino Servo DC Motor Arduino Library
This is an Arduino library to control Rhino Servo DC Motors (UART) which are available at <a href="http://www.robokits.co.in/" target="_blank">robokits.co.in</a> (for example: <a href="http://robokits.co.in/motors/high-torque-encoder-dc-servo-motor-10rpm-with-uart-i2c-ppm-drive?cPath=2_71&" target="_blank">10 RPM Rhino Servo DC Motor</a>). The Rhino Servo DC motor consists of a base motor, a gear train, an optical encoder and a micro-controller unit (with closed-loop PID control), all built-in, which makes it a highly functional motor for varied applications, especially robotics. The motor provides high torque, has zero backlash and is impressively precise for its price range. This library is a user-friendly approach to operate/control the motor.

For installation and documentation, visit <a href="http://samvrit.tk/high-torque-rhino-servo-dc-motor-arduino-library/" target="_blank">this page</a>.

The library is released for public, under the GNU GPL v3 license.
